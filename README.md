# React-Native-Project

We didn't have online laundry Booking service at our student housing. So, I came up with the idea of making our own project of Laundry booking App for Hops where user can book laundry time slots and also report any complaints or issues of their Apartment to the housing company directly. We used RESTFUL API along with Google Cloud for backend.
