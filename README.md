# React-Native-Project

We don't have an online laundry Booking service at our student housing. So, We came up with the idea of making our own prototype project of a Laundry booking App for Hops where users can book laundry time slots and also report any complaints or issues with their Apartment to the housing company directly. We used RESTFUL API along with Google Cloud for the backend and React Native as the Frontend.
